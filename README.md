My name is Esther Wyatt. This project uses html, css, and javascript to allow users to search for giphs. It displays gifs from an API source based on whatever keyword the user searches for in the search input space. The gifs are displayed 10 per page in a grid format. Users can hit the search button to search for specific gifs and then toggle through the gifs using the previous and next buttons. 
This project uses html, css, and javascript. If I were to improve the app in the future, I would make it possible for the gifs to be downloaded. In the furture I would also find a way to filter out innapropriate or lewd gif content. Finnaly I would improve the project by having the website, when you search for a specific image, tell you how many pages of gifs there are to comb through.
